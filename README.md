## **Summary**

<pre>
Not as simple as it looks!  Lot's of detail in writing this program.  I spent a lot of time going through each element of the code line by line to get it to work.
This was a huge challenge for me, as often when one thing was fixed it broke something else.  Or when everything up until that point worked, I would add a new thing
and the program would fail.  This program was a tricky balancing act that tested my resolve as a programmer.  I learned quite a lot with this program and though it took me
quite a few weeks to put it together I have come out of it a much stronger an more capable programmer.

I learned how to work more closely with event handlers.  I learned how to debug in an event driven program, while getting lot's of practice working through the logic to
make it all work.  So, without further adiou, go to the github page, and enjoy!
